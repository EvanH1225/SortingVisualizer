# SortingVisualizer

This is a sorting algorithm visualizer with four algorithms available:
1. Selection Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Bubble Sort

The size of the array that's being sorted and the speed at which the array is sorted can be adjusted, but unfortunately
it can only be done inside of the code :(
